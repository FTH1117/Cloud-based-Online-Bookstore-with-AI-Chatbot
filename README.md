# Cloud-based-Online-Bookstore-with-AI-Chatbot
Foong Tze Hing's fyp project

This online bookstore is hosted through a cloud service provided by a cloud provider. 
This cloud-based online bookstore will provide basic online shopping functions, 
including login system, registration system, product display page, shopping cart system, purchase system, search system, admin interface, etc. 
In addition, the online bookstore will be supported by AI, which will be used for customer service system. 
The user can communicate with the AI chatbot, which will analyze the user's chat history and provide assistance to the user. 
In the system, the user can find physical and digital books and get access to them after purchase. 
For physical books, the system asks the user to provide a shipping address and mails the product to that address. 
If the user purchases a digital book, the user gets the right to download the book. 
In addition to this, the user can use artificial intelligence to perform the above operations instead of the user. 
The user does not need to search for the desired button or information in a complex interface through the AI system. 
The user only needs to talk to the AI assistant on the AI chatbot's interface, and the AI assistant will provide the relevant information or link portal directly. 
Unlike a traditional online bookstore, a cloud-based online bookstore is a system built through cloud services. 
Compared with traditional online bookstores, cloud-based online bookstores have many advantages, including cost saving, space saving, more secure, etc.
